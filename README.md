# CYBER-AID-CYBERBULLYING-APP

## Problem Statement
The more we venture into the virtual world, the more our lives are becoming susceptible to **Cyberbullying**. With the advancement in the virtual era, the issue has been on a rise. It is becoming a norm, but it shouldn’t be. Cyberbullying is a very underestimated issue, the gravity that it carries is very big though. With so many social media and gaming platforms emerging and the tender age that children in this age begin using this platforms, cyberbullying is bound to happen. Mature people are able to deal with it to some extent, but adolescents are heavily impacted by it. It causes low self-esteem, depression and has even led to some suicides in some cases.

## Inspiration
The inspiration came after one of our teammates watched a Netflix documentary named **Audrie and Daisy**. It portrays the lives of two teenage girls, who in their teenage were raped and then heavily cyber bullied by their peers after the incident was leaked out. While Audrey ended up committing a suicide some days after the incident, Daisy fought and made it till the age of 23, when she also ended up taking the same step.
There are so many silent victims of cyberbullying all around the world.


# Cyber Aid
Parents in many places find it overwhelming to keep up with the technologies.
Teenagers often experience cyberbullying, some parents might not even know that their minor kid is being bullied on these platforms. This is where Cyber-Aid fits in--it makes it easier for parents to monitor any bad messages received by the kid, keep up with this issue through the latest news, statistics, and tweets, report any such incident, and with expert guidance on how to prevent and handle their kids if they are being subjected to it. It also includes information on how to monitor their kids activities and use parental controls on the most common social media platforms.
For the normal user module, the main thing would be the reporting section, anonymously or using their real identity, and forward the same to your trusted contacts and educators.

4. **Report Screen**:

So we came up with the feature of ‘Reporting an incident of cyberbullying’. 
We created an api in which has the official ids to forward the complaint to, of most of the countries. You don’t have to scavenge the internet to get one.
* Just write your complaint and attach any evidence you have(we support images, audio and video attachments).  
* Next you also have the option to forward it to any/all of the emergency contacts that you set in your profile.
* You also have the option to send it anonymously, as in when you submit the complaint, it won’t be forwarded to the portal directly. It would be forwarded to a social worker/volunteer who would then take up the issue and do the necessary step. 
* If the anonymous option is not selected the complaint will be forward to the official id of your country, dealing with such issues.
* On clicking the submit button, the above mentioned things will be done.
* You can also click on the call button and you will be redirected on your selected provider for calling with the number of the helpline number of your set country.
